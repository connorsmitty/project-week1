# project-week1

For this module we were tasked with creating a more simplified version of the code that was provided to us and make it more accesible for future changes. 

In order to complete the assignment properly all components must be functional as well as stick to the 
original layout that was provided to us.

Some of the attributes that I changed: added/reworded titles to html elements for easier navigation as well as simplified some of the CSS attributes that were repeats of the same elements.

The task is complete when the github repository is assesible as well as the URL to the website is functioning and displays the website appropriatly to meet guidlines.
